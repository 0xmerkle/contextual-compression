The presently reviewed study directly contradicts these recommendations; winter swimmers tended to be leaner than well-matched controls, and had more robust thermogenic responses to cold exposure. Cold-induced increases in energy expenditure of nearly 50% (relative to thermoneutral energy expenditure), but this is far from the norm. Other studies often report values around the 15% range (2, 3), with a high degree of variability from person to person. In addition, it’s critical to recognize that this is the elevation observed during cold exposure; if you increase your resting metabolic rate by 250 kcal/day, but you only engage in one hour of cold exposure, you’re talking about an absolute increase of less than 11kcal (in other words, an entirely negligible amount). My skepticism is comprehensively echoed in a recent review paper by Marlatt and colleagues (4).
